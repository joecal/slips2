# Project 2 Evaluation
[inline code comments]()
## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
>Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class

Good use of multiple models and associations here. On top of that, +1 for validations and hand-rolled authentication. I think some useful additional functionality would be to be able to compare user-submitted answers with the correct one.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

I LOVE this project idea. We're constantly looking out for ways to improve Slips so I'm sure there are features we can pull from this. App looks great too -- good use of Bootstrap.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
>Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues

Your code was very readable -- no complaints here. I think you'll find multiple opportunities for refactoring in your controllers -- definitely look into `before_action`.

## Deployment and Functionality
**2: Performing**
>Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.

Your deployed app seems to be functioning just like your local one. Good job!

## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Performing**
>Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues.

Nice readme. I would suggest looking through readme's of popular repos and see what other sections might be useful to anybody testing out Slips 2.0. Also look into [markdown formatting](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) -- a nice, easy way of making readmes look much better.

I can't seem to find any planning documentation though (e.g., wireframes, ERDs). Let me know if you have those and I'd be happy to take a look / update this.
