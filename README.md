# Slips 2.0

*** This is a revision of the original Slips program. ***

*** Installation Instructions ***

  Deployed App - http://slips2.herokuapp.com

  Operation Screencast - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aiGxdGbzaY

*** Technologies Used ***

  - HTML
  - CSS - Bootstrap
  - Ruby on Rails

*** Approach taken ***

  I mainly wanted to eliminate repeat questions that have already been answered.

*** Unsolved Problems ***

  I want to be able to submit/create a new answer directly from the "users show page" instead of having to click the answer button and be taken to the "new question answer show page".
